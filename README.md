# About Project

I wanted to make a responsive corporate website as a personal challenge to myself to practice website design, CSS animations, and React components.

Because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite TV shows, I decided to make the website for the fictional company, Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

I used React to build this app. I made sure to follow the React practice of code-splitting by having several components. For styling I used regular CSS and Tailwind CSS. For the copy on the website, instead of using Lorem Ipsum, I decided to use Chat GPT to generate the text.

This was a fun project for code practice and I hope you enjoy!
