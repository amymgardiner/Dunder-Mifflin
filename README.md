# About Project

I wanted to make a responsive corporate website as a personal challenge to myself to practice website design, CSS animations, and React components.

Because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite TV shows, I decided to make the website for the fictional company, Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

I used React to build this app. I made sure to follow the React practice of code-splitting by having several components. I used the [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) library to have the navigation function correctly, so users can get to each individual page.

For styling, I used regular CSS and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). For the copy on the website, instead of using Lorem Ipsum, I decided to use [Chat GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to generate the text.

I added movement to the page using parallax and [animate-on-scroll](https://dbramwell.github.io/react-animate-on-scroll/) elements, as well as a video and [slider](https://react-slick.neostack.com/).

For images used on the page, I found general pictures on Google from The Office TV show and utilized [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [unDraw](https://undraw.co/search), and [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

All buttons and links on the pages will work except for any shop or careers buttons as I did not build those pages out.

This was a fun project for code practice and I hope you enjoy it!
